# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using C++ in 2024.  
This project was built independently without using external references as part of my self-learning journey.

The game uses **matrix-based input (row and column values)** to place moves on the board, helping strengthen my understanding of 2D arrays.

Although the code may not be fully optimized, it works correctly and reflects my growing confidence in programming.

## 📌 About the Project

This is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal.  
Players enter **row and column numbers** to place their marks (`X` and `O`) on a 3×3 grid.

Example input: 0 0 => for 1st rows 1st column
Example input: 0 1 => for 1st rows 2nd column

This project focuses on:

- Using 2D arrays (matrix)
- Applying game logic
- Handling user input
- Working with loops and conditions
- Improving problem-solving skills

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player mode
- Matrix-based (row-column) input system
- Console-based interface
- Winner detection
- Draw condition handling

## ▶️ How to Play

1. The board is a 3×3 matrix.
2. Rows and columns are indexed from `0` to `2`.
3. Players take turns entering row and column numbers.
4. The selected cell must be empty.
5. First player to match three in a row wins.

## 📝 Reflection

Building this project using matrix input helped me understand how 2D arrays work in real applications.

It improved my logical thinking and gave me confidence to build complete programs independently.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add AI (single-player mode)
- Add score system
- Better error handling
- Code optimization
